         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying Biblical Studies with a minor in music.</p>

            I enjoy serving the Lord through music and teaching, and I am active in my local church: Faith Baptist Church of Easley, SC.  I teach Junior Church for the kids, and I sing in the choir and play in orchestra during services.
